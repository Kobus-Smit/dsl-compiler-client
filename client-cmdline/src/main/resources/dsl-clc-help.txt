# SYNOPSIS
  java -jar dsl-clc.jar [option1] [option2] # defaults to the "update" action
  java -jar dsl-clc.jar [option1] [option2] ... [action]

# DESCRIPTION
  The CommandLine Client transmits the DSL files over to the DSL Platform,
  schedules system upgrades and returns compiled sources and/or binaries.

# OPTIONS
  -h, --help
        Prints out this help.

  -u<username>, --username=<username>
  -p<password>, --password=<password>
        Credentials do not need to be provided - the client will attempt to
        read the last credentials from cache if present, and prompt otherwise.

  -d<dsl path>, --dsl-path=<dsl path>

  -o<output path>, --output-path=<output path>
        Generated code and binaries will be anchored to this path.
        WARNING: This path will be managed by the CommandLine Client,
        and should not be used for other purposes to prevent data loss!

  -f, --project-ini-path
        Path to the project.ini file, allowing most (or all) of the
        parameters to be read from a single source.
