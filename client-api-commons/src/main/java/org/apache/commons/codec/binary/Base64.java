/**
 * Provides Base64 encoding and decoding as defined by <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt">RFC 2045</a>.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class implements section <cite>6.8. Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding</cite> from RFC 2045 <cite>Multipurpose
 * Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies</cite> by Freed and Borenstein.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class can be parameterized in the following manner with various constructors:
 * <ul>
 * <li>URL-safe mode: Default off.</li>
 * <li>Line length: Default 76. Line length that aren't multiples of 4 will still essentially end up being multiples of
 * 4 in the encoded data.
 * <li>Line separator: Default is CRLF ("\r\n")</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since this class operates directly on byte streams, and not character streams, it is hard-coded to only
 * encode/decode character encodings which are compatible with the lower 127 ASCII chart (ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252,
 * UTF-8, etc).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is thread-safe.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt">RFC 2045</a>
